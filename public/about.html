<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am from Mesa, AZ. My family moved to Utah in 2010. I have worked as a sales/customer service representative for many years. I took on a Software Tester position and I have enjoyed being in this industry.
   I have three wonderful boys, my wife and I have been married for 16 years.
   
   Learning to code has been a fear of mine. I know coding can be hard, but I do like a challenge. My goal is to be able to handle the front-end code at the company I work for.
